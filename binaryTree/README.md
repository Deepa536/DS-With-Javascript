## Binary Tree
    Binary Tree is a DS that allows you to move through sorted data.

Tree starts with a `root` node and each has 2 child nodes `left` and `right` node.
### Creating a binary tree
Suppose array of unsorted numbers `[8,10,3,6,14,7,13,4,1]` Start from first number
8 i.e. root then if second number is smaller than root it should add left hand side else right hand side.

### Traversing Tree
        1.Start with root 
        2.Visit left(till end)
        3.When left node ends print the value
        4.then visit right node(if right node has children start from 1) and print

 So, the sorted array[1,3,4,6,7,8,10,13,14]
